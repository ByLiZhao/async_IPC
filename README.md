An easy non-blocking IPC library (single-user-single-client) built upon boost asio's asynchronous TCP facility.
The lib is written in favor of ease of usage, that one can simply use it wihout worrying about
1. asynchronous IO.
2. TCP communication
3. liftetime management of underlying objects.
4, thread saftey.
